Clean

I have been blogging on and off for since 2001\.

Lately, I've been in the off mode. Life has been busy the last six years. Raising kids, changing jobs, and dealing with the general curveballs life throws. Times for carefree thought are rare. When an opportunity presents itself, it is almost always limited to what you can do on your iPhone. So posting an Instrgram photo, sharing my status on Facebook, or reblogging on Tumblr is almost only what can be done.

There is an opportunity here.

I have often been depressed looking at this space, where my blog would reside, and see it going unused. I still go to my Tumblr. I go to my Instagram. My Facebook. I use the web of services and tools that pervade my daily life.

This page will now be the launching pad, the hub, the Grand Central Terminal of my interweb life. A small snippet of a post or a photo that leads to other photos will be placed here. To access the main content, simply click the link after the posting.
